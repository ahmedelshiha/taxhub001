# Client Portal Upgrade — Phased Roadmap with Epics & Tickets

Reference: See the full specification in [Client Portal Upgrade Plan](./client-portal-upgrade-plan.md).

This roadmap maps planned capabilities to the existing Next.js/Prisma codebase. It references concrete files and scripts, aligns with the enterprise addendum, and is structured for import into Linear/Jira.

Repo audit (highlights)
- Framework: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, Prisma/Postgres, Sentry, Upstash Redis. Key paths:
  - App shell: src/app/layout.tsx, src/components/providers/client-layout.tsx, src/components/ui/navigation.tsx
  - Landing content: src/app/page.tsx, src/components/home/hero-section.tsx, services-section.tsx, testimonials-section.tsx
  - Admin/menu system: src/lib/menu/defaultMenu.ts, src/stores/admin/*, src/components/admin/*
  - Tests/tooling: vitest, playwright, scripts/ci/*, semgrep rules
  - DB: prisma/schema.prisma with rich User, Tasks, Invoices, etc.

Conventions
- Use feature flags via NEXT_PUBLIC_* and server flags when landing risky features.
- RLS enforced in DB; add indices with migrations under prisma/migrations.
- All UI components accessible, RTL-ready, and localized (src/lib/i18n, locales/).

Recommended Architecture: Modular Component Structure
- Goals: smaller files (~100–150 LOC), independent testing, lazy loading, team parallelism, performance, maintainability, reusability.
- Foldering (example for Setup Wizard)
  - src/components/portal/business-setup/SetupWizard.tsx (shell)
  - src/components/portal/business-setup/tabs/{ExistingBusiness.tsx,NewStartup.tsx,Individual.tsx}
  - src/hooks/business-setup/{useSetupForm.ts,useLicenseLookup.ts}
  - src/lib/registries/{uae.ts,ksa.ts,egy.ts}
  - src/services/entities/entitySetup.ts (service layer)
  - src/app/api/entities/setup/route.ts and src/app/api/registries/[country]/[number]/route.ts
  - src/types/entitySetup.ts
- Patterns
  - next/dynamic + React.Suspense per tab; React.memo for pure views; ErrorBoundary per tab.
  - State isolation via Zustand store scoped to wizard; SWR per tab with cache keys; prefetch on tab focus.
  - Strict typing with zod schemas; idempotency keys for writes; audit events.
  - Accessibility: ARIA Tabs, roving tabindex, focus trap for dialogs; RTL mirroring.
- Testing
  - Unit tests for hooks/validators; component tests (Testing Library) for each tab; Playwright E2E flows; snapshot RTL.
- Performance
  - Code-split tabs, skeletons, defer non-critical requests; Sentry transactions around tab loads.

# Task Workflow

For each task:

1. Analyze: Read requirements, check dependencies, plan approach
2. Implement: Write clean code following established patterns
3. Validate: Test happy paths, edge cases, and compatibility
4. Document: Update action plan and proceed to next task

---

## Alignment With Existing Admin Users Module
- Current tech: React 19 + Suspense, dynamic imports (lazy), tab navigation (TabNavigation.tsx), unified UsersContextProvider composing data/UI/filter contexts, ErrorBoundary, performance metrics via lib/performance/metrics, toast notifications.
- Our modular recommendations match: per-tab code-splitting, context-scoped state, ARIA tabs, ErrorBoundary, telemetry. We will reuse these patterns for portal modules (Setup Wizard, Dashboard widgets, Features Hub) to ensure consistency.
- Action: replicate UsersContextProvider pattern for business-setup (SetupContextProvider) and compliance (ComplianceContextProvider); add performanceMetrics spans around tab loads; reuse TabNavigation for portal where appropriate.
